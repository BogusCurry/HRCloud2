# HRCloud2
A WIP private Cloud Platform.

The HRCloud2 is a personal Cloud Platform that will (hopefully) someday include 
all the same functionality as a standard end-user based Cloud platform.

Currently HRCloud2 is a standalone web-framework that DOES REQUIRE WordPress to be installed. 
THIS IS NOT A WORDPRESS PLUGIN!!! WordPress is only required to create and manage user-accounts.

HRCloud2 DOES NOT directly interact with, or add data to, a database during operation. All log and
cache files are internally controlled.

HRCloud2 is currently in an extremely early phase. I am working on completing basic functionality
of the cloudCore and it's GUI. Once that is established I will concentrate on establishing
the rest of the GUI and the iframer the CloudCore will run within, to enable simple testing
of the functions we've already designed or adopted from other applications. 

Once the full "Alpha-GUI" is up-and-running I will focus on getting the file conversion,
document scanning, virus-scanning, and other core functionality as bug-free as possible.

After that we will look into incorporating HRAI into HRCloud2 to make HRCloud2 an autonomous and
de-centralized and load-balancing network (hopefully). Added bonus: we should also be able to give 
it text commands too! Maybe someday voice commands. "Hello, Hrai!"
