WHERE WE ARE...
Our AJAX call to copy files from the permanent Cloud location to the TEMP cloud location is functional.

WHATS NEXT...
1. We want to make another Cowboy PHP video!!!
2. We want to add checkboxes to the items in our Cloud List.
3. We want to make each item in the Cloud list have an expanding set of options that rolls out of the bottom of
     the item in the list.
4. The roll-down box for each item in the Cloud list will contain the options to Copy, Delete, Move, Convert,
     Scan, Archive, or Dearchive the selected file.
5. The header-bar (the row of columns at the top of the Cloud List) will roll down and provide options for
     all of the items selected via the checkbox's for the items in the Cloud List.
6. We need to fix the Cleanup scripts so that items in the temp location older than 6 hours are actually removed.
